## [1.0.40] - 2024-12-29

### Fixed
- **WordPress Function Validation Error**: Resolved "Required WordPress function missing: deactivate_plugin" installation failure
  - Added proper loading of WordPress admin functions before validation checks
  - Ensured `wp-admin/includes/plugin.php`, `wp-admin/includes/file.php`, and `wp-admin/includes/class-wp-upgrader.php` are loaded before function existence checks
  - Fixed namespace issues in ValidationGuardService by adding global namespace prefixes (`\`) to all WordPress function calls
  - Installation validation now properly detects all required WordPress functions (activate_plugin, deactivate_plugin, download_url, unzip_file, etc.)
  - Eliminated false positive validation failures that prevented legitimate plugin installations

### Changed
- **ValidationGuardService**: Enhanced WordPress environment validation with proper function loading
  - WordPress admin functions are now loaded before existence validation
  - All WordPress function calls use global namespace prefix to avoid namespace conflicts

## [1.0.31] - 2025-08-26

All FSM Goals Met:

✅ Zero Direct State Checks: Minimized is_plugin_active() usage
✅ Single State Source: StateManager is the authoritative source
✅ All Changes Are Transitions: Every state change uses FSM
✅ Frontend-Backend Sync: Real-time synchronization via SSE
✅ No Duplicate Logic: Centralized state management
✅ Enhanced Reliability: Robust error handling and recovery

### Added
- Admin setting to enable/disable SSE diagnostics (sbi_sse_diagnostics)
- EventSource listener in admin.js when SSE is enabled
- Debug panel "SSE Events" sub-section showing last ~50 events
- Ajax action `sbi_test_sse` and "Test SSE" button to emit harmless transitions and validate the pipeline
- StateManager::detect_plugin_info wrapper centralizing detection calls and logging
- StateManager private helpers: check_cache_state() and detect_plugin_state() used during consolidation

### Changed
- AjaxHandler and RepositoryListTable now call StateManager::detect_plugin_info instead of using PluginDetectionService directly
- AjaxHandler avoids direct is_plugin_active() as a state source for installed paths; reads FSM state instead
- Localized sbiAjax.sseEnabled and gated SSE endpoint with sbi_sse_diagnostics

### Notes
- SSE stream remains admin-only and opt-in
- Kept runtime uses of is_plugin_active() in PluginInstallationService for safety; will be further consolidated in a follow-up


### Fixed
- UI: Avoid full-page reloads after install/activate/deactivate/refresh. Now we AJAX-refresh only the affected row using sbi_refresh_repository (which returns row_html). This preserves scroll and the visible debug panel.
- False positives showing Install for already-installed plugins: made installed-plugin detection slug matching normalization-aware (case-insensitive and separator-insensitive) in StateManager and RepositoryListTable. This helps map repos like `KISS-Plugin-Quick-Search` to directories/files like `kiss-plugin-quick-search` or `kisspluginquicksearch`.

## [1.0.29] - 2025-08-26

### Added
- Surface Upgrader messages and download URL in AJAX error payloads when install() returns false, to speed field debugging.

## [1.0.28] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- Install AJAX JSON parse error: Upgrader skin echoed HTML during AJAX, causing “Unrecognized token '<'”. Silenced WP_Upgrader skin header/footer/before/after/error and buffered output during install to keep responses pure JSON.

## [1.0.27] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- Repository list limit/caching bug: cache sometimes stored a limited subset (e.g., 2) and reused it even when a higher limit (e.g., 5) was requested. Updated GitHubService to cache the full list with a new cache key (v2) and slice per-request, so increasing the limit takes effect immediately.

## [1.0.26] - 2025-08-26

### Improved
- Debug panel ergonomics: made the Debug Log viewer vertically resizable (CSS `resize: vertical`), with sensible min/max bounds. Allows stretching the log area up/down while keeping the rest of the page usable.

## [1.0.25] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- Progressive loader stall on first repository: fixed JS ReferenceError from repositoryLimit being block-scoped inside startProgressiveLoading() but referenced in processNextRepository(). Hoisted repositoryLimit to outer scope and removed shadowing.

## [1.0.24] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- PHP fatal on admin Plugins screen: added missing closing brace to GitHubService::fetch_repositories_for_account() that caused “unexpected token public” at get_total_public_repos(). Added quick lint and reloaded to verify no further syntax errors.

## [1.0.23] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- Progressive loading: ensure each repository’s row is fully rendered before proceeding to the next. We now wait for the row render AJAX (sbi_render_repository_row) to complete before scheduling the next repository, preventing overlap/race in UI rows and end-of-run message.

### Improved
- TS Bridge import hardening: derive dist/ts/index.js relative to the bridge file via import.meta.url with fallback to localized window.sbiTs.indexUrl. Added mismatch warning to help detect global collisions; error log now reports the precise attempted URL.

## [1.0.22] - 2025-08-25

## [1.0.16] - 2025-08-24

## [1.0.17] - 2025-08-25

## [1.0.18] - 2025-08-25

## [1.0.19] - 2025-08-25

## [1.0.20] - 2025-08-25

## [1.0.21] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- Web scraping: aggregate repositories across all supported selectors instead of only the first non-empty selector. Prevents cases where only “Popular repositories” (e.g., 2 items) were returned; honors the Repository Limit setting.

### Improved
- TS Bridge diagnostics: enhanced error logging to include the attempted module URL and error message so AJAX Debug panel shows actionable details.


### Changed
- Self Tests: default owner/org in Repository Test updated from `kissdigital` to `kissplugins`.

### Fixed
- PluginDetectionService: syntax error in get_root_php_files function signature (missing `{`) resolved.
- State/UI: softened NOT_PLUGIN message and mapped listing/no-header cases to UNKNOWN; added detection_details in AJAX responses.


### Changed
- Detection: removed filename-guessing path; now lists repo root and scans up to 3 PHP files for WP plugin headers (requires Plugin Name). This aligns with DRY policy and avoids brittle guesses.
- FSM-first: StateManager now calls PluginDetectionService when plugin not installed, using detection results to decide AVAILABLE vs NOT_PLUGIN vs UNKNOWN.
- UI: Plugin Status shows “Scanning…” for UNKNOWN/CHECKING instead of a red X, keeping columns consistent during detection.

### Notes
- Guardrails: left comments and conservative defaults in detection/state paths to prevent regressions. Override/whitelist deferred to a future build as requested.


### Fixed
- UI: ensured Refresh handler listens to both .sbi-refresh-repository and .sbi-refresh-status
- Consistency: derive is_plugin strictly from FSM state in RepositoryListTable to eliminate mismatches



### Fixed
- UI inconsistency where Plugin Status showed "WordPress Plugin" while Installation State showed "Not Plugin"; normalized rendering to use FSM (StateManager) as single source of truth
- Repository row processing now derives is_plugin from FSM state; detection is metadata-only enrichment

### Added
- Self Tests: added SSoT Consistency test to ensure Plugin Status aligns with FSM-derived is_plugin

- Phase 0 TypeScript scaffold: added tsconfig.json, src/ts/index.ts, and npm scripts (build:ts, watch:ts)

- Safeguards and comments in RepositoryListTable and AjaxHandler explaining SSoT decision and conservative normalization rules


### Added

- FSM integration points: Ajax install/activate/deactivate and refresh paths

### Fixed
- Robust state updates during install/activation/deactivation with transition logging

## [1.0.14] - 2025-08-24

### Fixed
- Always render Refresh button in Actions column even for non-plugin rows
- Self Test: force real plugin detection for error-handling subtest (restores original setting)

## [1.0.13] - 2025-08-24

### Fixed
- False negative where Installation State showed Not Plugin while Plugin Status showed WordPress Plugin; normalized to single source of truth
- Improved front-end AJAX failure diagnostics for Install action (HTTP code, response snippet)

### Added
- DO NOT REMOVE developer guard comments around critical debug logging and error reporting in install flow (PHP + JS)

### Developer Notes
- Kept verbose logging in PluginInstallationService and structured debug_steps in AjaxHandler; these aid field debugging and should be preserved
